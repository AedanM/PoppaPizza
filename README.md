Work on a fun little restaurant sim.

## Concept

What if a bunch of restaurants couldn't afford individual working spaces so decided to work together in 1 building. The only issue is that the health inspector wouldn't tolerate that under city guidelines, so staff have to constantly change outfits to pretend they only work for 1 business.
