Work on a fun little restaurant sim.

## Concept

What if a bunch of restaurants couldn't afford individual working spaces so decided to work together in 1 building. The only issue is that the health inspector wouldn't tolerate that under city guidelines, so staff have to constantly change outfits to pretend they only work for 1 business.

## Releases

Latest version in an EXE can be found in the Releases folder. Releases will be packaged into executables but python dependencies still listed in [requirements.txt](Docs/requirements.txt)
